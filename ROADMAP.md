# Roadmap

This page tracks planned features and longer-term research directions for `mrmopt`.
Items are organized by horizon and reflect both near-term engineering work and
more exploratory modeling directions.

Feedback and contributions are welcome — open an issue on

## Recently Shipped

### Within-Channel Hierarchical Response Curves

**New function:** `fit_response_hier()` — **shipped.** See the
[Hierarchical Response Curves](https://bdshaff.github.io/mrmopt/articles/hierarchical_curves.html)
article for a worked example, and `design/fit_response_hier.md` for the design.

Media channels are rarely homogeneous. TV spend spans broadcast, cable, and
streaming — each with different audience reach and response dynamics. Social
covers multiple partners, tactics, and creatives. Standard response curve
modeling treats the channel as a single unit, which either overfits sparse
sub-channel data or discards granularity altogether.

`fit_response_hier()` fits a single hierarchical model for one channel where
curve parameters are partially pooled across sub-channel groupings:

```r
fit_tv <- fit_response_hier(
  data      = tv_data,
  spend     = "spend",
  kpi       = "conversions",
  date      = "week",
  group     = c("subtype", "station"),   # nested hierarchy (any depth)
  type      = "gompertz"
)
```

The fixed effects represent the channel-level mean curve. Random effects at
each level (subtype → station) are drawn from the level above, so sparse units
(e.g., a small cable station with a handful of weeks) borrow strength from
better-identified peers. The degree of shrinkage is automatic and
data-driven — units with more observations get pulled less toward the group mean.

**Delivered:**

- Channel-level, sub-type-level, and unit-level curves from a single model
  (`mrm_summary_hier()`, `mrm_infer_hier()`)
- All six curve forms, including the log-based forms (midpoint reparameterized
  internally on the log scale for sampling stability)
- Arbitrary-depth nested hierarchies
- Posterior uncertainty correctly reflects data sparsity at each level
- Optimization at any level of the hierarchy via `as_mrmfit_list()` + `opt_mix()`
- Per-unit and shrinkage visualizations via `mrm_plot_hier()`
- Pooling operates on curve shape parameters (`b`, `e`); scale (`d`) is
  allowed to vary more freely to reflect size differences across units

## Medium-Term

### Cross-Channel Synergy Model

**New function:** `fit_response_synergy()`

Standard media response modeling assumes channels contribute independently and
additively to KPI. This is a simplifying assumption that most MMM tools carry
forward without question. In practice, simultaneous investment across channels
may produce efficiency gains (or losses) that a purely additive model misses.

`fit_response_synergy()` fits a joint model across all channels where pairwise
interaction terms — one per channel pair — capture residual co-efficiency
signals beyond what the individual response curves predict:

```r
fit_syn <- fit_response_synergy(
  models = list(tv = fit_tv, social = fit_social, search = fit_search, ...),
  data   = joint_data
)
```

With 9 channels, there are 36 possible pairwise interaction terms. To prevent
overfitting and handle the near-certain multicollinearity between channels,
all interaction terms are regularized with a **horseshoe prior** — a
sparsity-inducing prior that shrinks most interactions toward zero while
allowing a small number of well-identified interactions to remain.

**Important framing:** Interaction terms estimated on attributed KPI volumes
should be interpreted as *predictive efficiency corrections*, not causal
synergies. The upstream attribution model that produced the attributed volumes
already assumed channel independence. These terms capture residual signal in
the data useful for optimization, not a structural causal claim.

**Key properties:**

- Per-channel nonlinear response curves (Hill / Log-Logistic parameterization)
- Horseshoe-regularized pairwise interaction terms
- Collinearity diagnostics per channel pair — warns when an interaction is
  likely unidentifiable due to correlated spend patterns
- Interaction terms are opt-in; default behavior remains independent channels

### Adstock Support

Estimated geometric adstock decay integrated into `fit_response()` via an
optional `adstock = TRUE` argument. The decay parameter will be estimated
jointly with the saturation curve parameters and carry full posterior
uncertainty, consistent with Meridian's approach.

```r
fit <- fit_response(
  data    = my_data,
  spend   = "tv_spend",
  kpi     = "conversions",
  date    = "week",
  type    = "gompertz",
  adstock = TRUE   # estimate decay parameter jointly
)
```

Default prior: `Uniform(0, 1)` on the decay parameter — uninformative,
consistent with Meridian's defaults. Users can tighten this with domain
knowledge about carryover windows for specific channels.

## Longer-Term / Exploratory

### Ground-Up Joint MMM (`fit_mmm()`)

`mrmopt` currently operates as a **response curve layer** — it fits saturation
curves to attributed KPI volumes produced by an upstream MMM. This is a valid
and practical workflow, but it means the saturation parameters are estimated
on data that already has an implicit independence and linearity assumption
baked in by the attribution model.

A ground-up joint MMM would estimate adstock decay, saturation curve
parameters, and channel contribution coefficients *simultaneously* from raw
spend and total KPI data — the approach taken by
[Google Meridian](https://github.com/google/meridian) and
[PyMC-Marketing](https://www.pymc-marketing.io/).

This would be implemented via a hand-written Stan model using
[`CmdStanR`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) as the backend, giving full
control over the model structure without the constraints of the `brms`
formula interface. Priors would be aligned with Meridian's published defaults
(`ec ~ TruncatedNormal(0.8, 0.8, 0.1, 10)` on normalized spend,
`decay ~ Uniform(0, 1)`, `beta ~ HalfNormal(5)`).

**Key design:** A new `fit_mmm()` function returning a `mrmfit_joint` S3
class that feeds into the existing `opt_mix()` optimization infrastructure
via the same draw-matrix interface used by the posterior optimization path.

This is a substantial modeling and engineering undertaking and will be
developed incrementally. Single-market models without geo-level hierarchy
are the initial target scope.
